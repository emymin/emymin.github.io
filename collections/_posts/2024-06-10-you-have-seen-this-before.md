Recently I stumbled upon a video by Youtube animator [u m a m i](https://www.youtube.com/@abstractdaddy) titled ["What Do You See?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGNmjx6S2v4)

<div style="text-align:center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rGNmjx6S2v4?si=cBgYEm3xV9IInQcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Anyone that has had their eyes checked by an optometrist at any point in their life might recognize what the video is referencing. During an eye examination, the doctor asks you to look into a strange machine and stare at a small picture. This picture often depicts some object, such as a balloon or a house, in the middle of an uncannily empty landscape. This is then often followed by a startling puff of air hitting your eye.

It is clear that in many people these images evoke some kind of emotional response. They have become quite popular online in the broader phenomenon of [liminal spaces](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/liminal-space-internet-aesthetic/671945/), for some even being an [entry point](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/1dtitfj/honestly_these_two_eye_test_pictures_are_how_i/). With these images having been in use for a while, many have [childhood memories](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/gf6box/first_liminal_place_i_remember_i_have_seen/) of seeing them during a visit to the doctor, which adds an element of nostalgia and intrigue.

![Barn seen through a circular lens](/assets/images/2024-06-10/barn_fisheye.jpg){: width="500" .centered }

Their liminality is undeniable. The distance between the viewer and the subject, the empty landscapes, the somewhat cartoony colorful style as well as the odd framing give them that mysterious, uncanny, but also somewhat nostalgic feel that is characteristic of liminal space imagery.
It feels like images that would be found in a children's picture book, but at the same time the subjects are so oddly distant and the landscapes are so eerily... devoid of life.

By virtue of being strange pictures used exclusively in specialized medical equipment that also happen to play directly in a popular internet phenomenon, [there has been interest](https://twitter.com/gavinbena/status/1741689644788437135) in finding out more information about them. What's the deal with these pictures? Where were they taken? Can we find the original, unedited versions?

After going down the *very specific* rabbit hole of **autorefractor images**, I think I can provide some answers to these questions.

## Autorefractors

First of all, why do these images exist in the first place? What is their purpose exactly?

For [optometrists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry) one of the key diagnostic devices is the [autorefractor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580520/). Its purpose is to measure the refractivity of the eye in order to test for nearsightedness or farsightedness.
In a modern clinical setting, this device generally comes in a table-top device that also [bundles](https://www.nidek-intl.com/product/ophthaloptom/refraction/ref_auto/tonoref3.html) a [tonometer](https://eyewiki.aao.org/IOP_and_Tonometry), which is the infamous air puff device used to measure the eye's pressure, as well as a [keratometer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580516/), which measures the curvature of the cornea in order to diagnose astigmatism.

![Autorefractor Machine](/assets/images/2024-06-10/autorefractor.jpg){: width="250" .centered}

As mentioned in [this patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5684561A), one of the difficulties with taking accurate measurements of the eye is it being a pretty dynamic organ in constant movement. This is especially problematic with children, who have a pretty hard time keeping the eye still for prolonged periods of time.

One technique that is employed to get around this issue is having a small picture to stare at with a very distinct, far away focus point. The patent mentions as examples "a sailboat on the ocean, a tractor in a field, or a balloon in the sky".

The specific images that are used seem to vary from company to company, however there are three main images that people associate with these devices


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![A balloon floating at the end of a road](/assets/images/2024-06-10/balloon.jpg){: width="200"} ![Some kind of building with a red roof and a long fence leading up to it](/assets/images/2024-06-10/barn.jpg){: width="200"} ![A house with a red roof in the middle of a field](/assets/images/2024-06-10/field.jpg){: width="200"}
{: refdef}

I will therefore be focusing the investigation specifically on these three images.

## The Balloon

![A balloon floating at the end of a road](/assets/images/2024-06-10/balloon.jpg){: width="500" .centered}

The balloon image seems to be the most popular out of the three. It is iconic enough to appear in [advertisments](https://youtu.be/5bE_v1e_mwM?si=kQsJECGwOfiWgNKP&t=30) and have a [small horror game](https://moaxx.itch.io/the-nightmare-of-the-air-balloon) based around it. By virtue of its popularity, it is also the one of which the most public information is available.

It is used in the autorefractor machines of a japanese company called [Nidek](https://www.nidek.co.jp/), which specializes in optical medical equipment.

[![Screenshot of Nidek's Facebook post](/assets/images/2024-06-10/nidek_facebook.jpg){: width="500" .centered}](https://www.facebook.com/nidek.sg/posts/1818076718372651)


Nidek very much embraces how iconic this picture has become. As seen at the end of [this comic](https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/160308195883), the image is framed in their offices. Additionally, Nidek has sponsored [air balloon races](https://www.nidek-intl.com/news-event/news/entry-1863.html) as well as [air balloon rides](https://www.nidek-intl.com/themes/en/csr/report/pdf/report_2017.pdf) for local elementary schools.

![Picture of the ballon image framed in Nidek's offices, with two people posing in front](/assets/images/2024-06-10/framed_balloon.jpg){: width="500" .centered}

Through a [news article](https://www.nidek.co.jp/news-event/news/entry-3712.html) on their website, we can find that the image is called <ruby>気<rt>ki</rt>球<rt>kyuu</rt>チャート<rt>chaato</rt></ruby> (balloon chart), and was registered as a [trademark](https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/TR/JP-2019-105088/40/ja) in 2019.
Oddly enough, as pointed out in [this blog post](https://isgs-lab.com/565/), a black and white version of the balloon alone was also [registered](https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/TR/JP-2019-105089/40/ja).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

According to an [interview](https://maidonanews.jp/article/14794704) with maidonanews, the image is a manipulation of an actual photograph of a road in Arizona, USA. This was chosen because the founder of the company, having studied abroad in the United States, had grown fond of the country and aspired to become the top seller of medical equipment in America.

The interview also establishes that this image has been in use since 90s. 
In the before mentioned [comic](https://dailyportalz.jp/kiji/160308195883), it is claimed that the image is 25 years old. With the publication date of the comic being 2016, this would date the picture at around 1991, which seems to match.

Starting out, instead of the balloon picture, their autorefractors used radial images called "starbursts". Later on, an airplane was placed in the center of the chart to have a more direct focus point. Since it was still hard to keep a steady line of sight, it was later swapped out with the photograph of the road, on top of which a balloon was composited.
According to the interview, the company was the first to employ color images in these devices.

In a [news segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYpm0pCbcXc) on ANNnewsCH, it is revealed that the balloon is actually an illustration, and the picture of the road was taken somewhere in Monument Valley.
The show also hazards a guess as to the specific location, settling on somewhere along Route 163

![Screenshot of the guessed location](/assets/images/2024-06-10/news_guess.jpg){: width="500" .centered}


As an aside, it is oddly fitting for this image to have been taken in Monument Valley, as another picture that is a [very popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/ung9l6/this_picture_of_moment_valley_always_felt_liminal/) example of liminal space imagery is this photograph of Monument Valley by [Dino Kuznik](https://www.pellicolamag.com/blog/dino-kuznik/)

![Liminal Photograph of Monument Valley](/assets/images/2024-06-10/monument_valley.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

To date there is no definitive confirmation of the *exact* location of the original photograph. With the rise of the [professional Geoguessr](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846869/geoguessr-competitive-esport-reddit-geowizard-google-street-view) scene however, it might not remain a mystery for much longer! If there is any update on the matter, I will make sure to include it.

The balloon chart is not the only image used by this company. In this [news entry](https://www.nidek.co.jp/news-event/news/entry-2020.html) on their website, a "flower chart" can also be seen, while for children there is a  [mention](https://www.nidek.co.jp/news-event/news/entry-2770.html) of a chart featuring the mascot [Kumamon](https://kumamon-land.jp/) sitting in a field. 

![Flower Chart](/assets/images/2024-06-10/flower_chart.jpg){: .centered}

Nidek is also not the only company to feature balloons and roads in their autorefractors. For example, Canon [offers](https://mts.medical.canon/ophthalmic/lineup/rk-f3m.html) autorefractor machines featuring two different balloon pictures!

![Canon's Balloon Images](/assets/images/2024-06-10/canon_balloons.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

## The Barn

![Barn with a long fenced path leading up to it](/assets/images/2024-06-10/barn.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

When I first saw this image, I actually wasn't entirely sure if it was an actual picture used in autorefractors, or if it was an artistic recreation. The hazy lighting, odd blurriness and saturated colors gave it a look that immediately reminded me of [Dreamcore](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamcore), an aesthetic movement adjacent to liminal spaces.

Turns out however that it is an actual image used in the products of the Japanese optical equipment manufacturer [Topcon](https://global.topcon.com).

This is confirmed by an [article](https://www.topcon.co.jp/media/healthcare/eyesight-measurement/) on their website, where they directly reference the image. They have been in business since 1947, and this red-roofed house is used in one of their top products called the Autoref (オートレフ).

In [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/14i09ag/if_you_need_me_ill_be_chillin_at_the_eye_exam/), User **RadicalEdward2** identified the original unaltered version of the picture to be this photograph

![Original image of the barn](/assets/images/2024-06-10/barn_original.jpg){: .centered}

Indeed many features seem to match, such as the shape of the fence, despite having clearly been heavily manipulated to make the building appear much further away. The building is also strikingly similar.

Other elements, such as the trees and the particular pattern of the shadows, however, bring this theory into question. If it is the original unedited version, then there was some severe amount of manipulation involved. However it is clear that it is depicting the same location.

Oddly enough, one little tower on the right of the building was also removed, though this could just have been done to ensure that there wouldn't be multiple competing focus points.

In a comment by user **CuratorOfYourDreams** in the same thread, it is claimed that the picture depicts **Manchester Farm** in Lexington, Kentucky. This is also reiterated by a comment by user **GabrielWB** on [this danbooru post](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/7607551), which goes as far as to provide a precise [Google Maps location](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.0607711,-84.6003718,3a,75y,203.77h,76.5t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sJ7ssZtMBffjepDzMmofm9g!2e0!5s20150801T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu)

![Google maps screenshot before 2023](/assets/images/2024-06-10/googlemaps_old.jpg){:width="400" .centered} ![Google maps screenshot from 2023](/assets/images/2024-06-10/googlemaps_new.jpg){:width="400" .centered}

*It seems that, sometime between 2015 and 2023, the long fence leading up to the building was removed*

According to the [Manchester Farm's website](http://www.manchesterfarmky.com/), the farm was purchased in 1976 by Houston Oilman Mike G. Rutherford and currently serves as a nursery for racehorses. It also claims to be one of the most recognizable farms in Kentucky, which I think accounts for how easily it was identified online.

![Picture showing the side of the barn](/assets/images/2024-06-10/barn_side.jpg){: width="500" .centered}

Indeed many more pictures of this building can be found not only on their website but all over the Internet, which indicates that this farm is an heavily photographed landmark of the area. It wouldn't be surprising therefore if, when creating a picture for their autorefractor, the picture was found simply by looking up something akin to "american farm" on a website like Flickr or Pinterest


## The Field

![House in the middle of a field](/assets/images/2024-06-10/field.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

Together with the balloon chart, this picture of a small barn sitting in the middle of a field has also gained a great deal of notoriety. An artwork seemingly based on it called [What We All Have Seen](https://otafinearts.viewingrooms.com/content/feature/398/artworks-2152-ouada-what-we-all-have-seen-2018/) by artist [youada](https://www.instagram.com/youada/) was showcased at an [Ota Fine Arts](https://www.otafinearts.com/) exhibit, and it is a very common subject in [liminal space art](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/w5afbn/pixelated_eye_test/).

My first impression was that, stylistically, it is very reminiscent of the works of famous japanese graphic designer [Hiroshi Nagai](https://www.vintag.es/2019/06/hiroshi-nagai-paintings.html). A lot of his art features clear skies, countryside landscapes with an overwhelming sense of stillness to them, and vegetation that is often drawn with a [pointillistic](https://artincontext.org/pointillism/) technique.

![Art of a field by Hiroshi Nagai](/assets/images/2024-06-10/hiroshinagai_field.jpg){:width="500" .centered} ![Landscape art by Hiroshi Nagai](/assets/images/2024-06-10/hiroshinagai_landscape.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

One thing that threw me off however was how surprisingly high resolution the picture was in almost every post. I later ran into [news articles](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1850988623_6e53d84f019011p9o.html) that included the image, and they would credit a graphic designer called **Bryce Wilner**

Indeed, on his [website](http://www.brycewilner.com/), there exists a webpage simply called [Autorefractor](http://autorefractor.brycewilner.com/). In this page (which is currently best viewed on Firefox/Safari) a 1920x1080 version of this image can be seen, with an animated blurring effect.

After contacting Wilner by email, he confirmed that he was the author of the image, and provided some additional context

> *That website is a 2017 artwork I made while I was studying design in grad school. I think I was interested in that autorefractor picture as a kind of test image. It’s an image that’s meant to demonstrate the various shapes a focusing eye makes—a scene that’s sublime and also completely forgettable. It’s like an image of everything and nothing.*
> 
> *I searched and searched for a high-res version of that image so I could animate it coming in and out of focus using HTML and CSS. The best I could do was a very low resolution JPEG, which I then completely redrew using design software, my memory of the image from my last optometrist appointment, and the low-res version as a reference. So in a way I am the author of the image on my site, but I have nothing to do with the images that are actually used as the background in an autorefractor machine.*
> 
> *As you indicate, this has led to a number of people republishing my drawing on other websites, and crediting me as the author of the original background image used in autorefractors. At this point, the citations are so many that I don’t see the point in trying to correct the record, unless someone asks me to clarify. Another demonstration of how easily we misunderstand internet images.*

So, while this specific image is a recreation and doesn't come from an actual autorefractor, there is some actual picture that it was directly based on.
My first guess was that it came from some **Topcon** device, given the similarity to the previous barn image, however it seemed they didn't have a machine with a similar picture. I could find however two different companies that use very similar imagery.

The first one is the chinese company [Visionstar](https://www.hyvisionstar.com/), which features on the product page of the [FA-6100A](https://www.hivisionstar.com/product/fa-6100a-auto-refractometer) autorefractor an *extremely* low res picture that appears to match very closely

![Cronchy Visionstar image](/assets/images/2024-06-10/visionstar.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

The second one is the korean company [Potec](http://potec.biz). On listings for their [PRK-5000](https://medoff.net/en/product/auto-ref-keratometer-potec-prk-5000) and [PRK-6000](https://nemes.com.tr/en/diagnostik-2/auto-ref-keratometre/prk-5000/) autorefractors I could find the following image

![Potec's Image](/assets/images/2024-06-10/potec.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

This is further confirmed by this [blog post](http://oceanoptometry.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-eye-examination-photo-series-part-1.html){:width="500"} which shows a photo of a Potec machine and the picture it contains.

![Photo of Potec Machine](/assets/images/2024-06-10/potec_in_action.jpg){:width="500" .centered}

I tried contacting both companies to see if I could get more details about the pictures but sadly received no response. If any additional information surfaces, I will definitely be updating this post.

## Conclusion

I was actually kind of surprised how much of the information was already available publicly on the internet, but either hidden behind language barriers or just way too scattered, for something as *specific* as autorefractor images.
It goes to show how important it is for the Internet to not just be an idle repository of information, but to be constantly shuffling and reorganizing in order to make that knowledge more and more accessible.

I hope that this post, by bringing all this information together in one place, is useful for all the people that, like me, are curious to know more about oddly specific stuff like this!
