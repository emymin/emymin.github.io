            <p>Creative Minecraft with mods is UNDERRATED</p>
            <p>I was inspired by channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Blisschen">Blisschen</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Kalitayy">Kality</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hasukko">Hasukko</a> to try doing some builds with mods like <a href="https://cocricot.pics/">Cocricot</a> and <a href="https://miniaturia.club/">Miniaturia</a></p>
            <p>I think I'm nowhere near as good but I found it fun, I hope more people will give it a try!</p>
