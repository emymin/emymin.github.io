My personal website, you can visit it [here](https://emymin.net)

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using pure HTML+CSS+Javascript, and hosted on Github Pages (https://emymin.github.io/)

## Building

1. Make sure [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) are installed
2. While in the working directory, install dependencies with ```bundle install```
3. Test by running ```bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload``` which will serve a preview at http://127.0.0.1:4000
    > Alternatively just build with ```bundle exec jekyll build```
4. Deploy by pushing the changes to the repo
